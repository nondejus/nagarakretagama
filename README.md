The manuscript
In 1894, the Dutch East Indies launched a military expedition against the Cakranegara royal house of Lombok. That year, the Dutch took the manuscript as part of the valuable Lombok treasure, war-booty from the destroyed palace of Mataram-Cakranagara in Lombok.[3][4] The first western scholar to study the manuscript was J.L.A. Brandes [nl], a Dutch philologist. He accompanied the KNIL expedition to Lombok in 1894, and is credited with saving the valuable manuscripts collection of the Lombok royal library from being burnt in the chaos of the battle. A generation of Dutch scholars participated in translating the poem.[2]

Much of its historical value was due to its having been the product of priestly activities directed at enhancing the magical powers of the ruler at the time.[5] The manuscript is written on lontar leaves. It was held in the library of Leiden University in the Netherlands, with inventory code number L Or 5.023.

After its translation in the early 20th century, the Nagarakretagama became an inspiration and foundation of the Indonesian independence movement.[6]

In 1970 during the state visit of president Suharto to the Netherlands, the manuscript was given back to Indonesia [7]. Today it is held by the National Library of Indonesia, with inventory code number NB 9. In May 2008 UNESCO recognised the significance of the Nagarakretagama by naming it "The Memory of the World - Regional Register for Asia/Pacific",[8] and finally registered it in 2013
